This is a simple complex number class.

	the main files include:

		-ComplexNumber.cpp
		-ComplexNubler.h

		-ComplexNumberTest.cpp

	Im not entirely sure what pch.h and .cpp are for.
	It was required to be included in the .cpp files for visual studios to compile.

Upon running the main file ComplexNumberTest.cpp it will generate a number set and test all the methods included in our ComplexNumber class.
