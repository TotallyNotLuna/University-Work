1. The .equals method from object is checking if the two objects given are the same object.
2.a more natural way of checking equality for Point2D would be to check if (X, Y) is equal to (x, y).
3. the toString method from object is returning the location in memory at which the object resides.
4. A better way of representing Point2D as a string would be to print out its point (x, y).
5. This implies that once a method is overriden it becomes absolute.
